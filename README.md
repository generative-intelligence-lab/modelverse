### The PyTorch code of model search algorithm will be coming soon!


 [Modelverse](https://modelverse.cs.cmu.edu/) is a model sharing and search platform that contains a diverse set of deep generative models such as GANs, diffusion models, and autoregressive models. This platform allows users to find, share, and study deep generative models more easily.<br>

Through Modelverse, we introduce the first content-based model search engine. Given a user query and a large set of generative models, we aim to the models that best match the query. The query could be an image, a sketch, a text description, another generative model, or a combination of these.

## Method Overview

Our search system consists of a pre-caching stage and an inference stage. Given a collection of models, we first generate 50K samples for each model. We then encode the images into image features and compute the 1st and 2nd order feature statistics for each model. The statistics are cached in our system for efficiency. At inference time, we support queries of different modalities (text, image, or sketch). We encode the query into a CLIP feature vector, and assess the similarity between the query feature and each modelâ€™s statistics. The models with the best similarity measures are retrieved.

## Search Results

**Qualitative results of model retrieval**. Below we show model retrieval results with three different modalities - images, sketches, and text.

Our method also enables multimodal queries (left) and using a model as a query to find similar models (right).
